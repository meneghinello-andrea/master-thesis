\chapter{Background}
\label{cap:background}
With this chapter we want to introduce our thesis talking about main problems that developers
encounter during their work. Our focus will be on cloud computing, with special
attention to \ac{paas} level of \ac{spi} cloud model, as a valid solution both for
companies\footnote{With the term companies we refer to which one that use applications, hence
excluding software-houses that produce applications.} and for developers.

We will start describing, in Section \ref{sec:background-problem}, some use-cases that illustrate
common scenarios that lead us to consider cloud computing model, in Section 
\ref{sec:background-cloudComputing} as solution for both companies and software-houses.
Later we will focus our attention on the \ac{paas} cloud model, Section \ref{sec:background-paas}, 
illustrating its main features and characteristics; we also discuss how this cloud model is possible
through virtualization, Section \ref{sec:background-virtualization}.

Progressively we will illustrate Docker, Section \ref{sec:background-docker}, a new \acs{os}
virtualization level technology that promise to change the \ac{paas} cloud model; we illustrate its
main characteristics, its architecture, how it provide data-management to conclude with a brief digression
about the state-of-the-art of security issues.

Finally Section \ref{sec:background-problem} will give a formal description of the problem that we
will face in the rest of the thesis.
