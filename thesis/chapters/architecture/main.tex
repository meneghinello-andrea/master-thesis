\chapter{Multi-tenant \& elastic architecture}
\label{cap:architecture}
After having analysed, in Chapter \ref{cap:measurements}, two virtualization alternative techniques that
a \ac{paas} provider can make available to us, we want to conclude our discussion talking about the other
side of the coin to obtain elasticity: the software architecture.

As we said in Chapter \ref{cap:elasticity}, elasticity can be obtained by blending together a virtualization
layer (that exploits as better as it can the underlying hardware) and a good software architecture (that is
able to take advantage of the functionalities provided by the virtualization layer).

Thus, in this chapter we want to discuss about \acf{soa} as a possible solution for building elastic and
multi-tenant applications or services. In particular in Section \ref{sec:architecture-introduction} we will
do a brief introduction about the state-of-the-art in software architectures to understand why they are not
good candidates to obtain elasticity. Hereafter, in Section \ref{sec:architecture-soa} we will introduce
the concept of \ac{soa} and we will explain how we can reconsider it in the cloud landscape. Finally, in
Section \ref{sec:architecture-proposal} we will discuss about a possible software architecture that can lead 
us to build elastic and multi-tenant applications combined with Docker containers.
