\chapter{Elasticity}
\label{cap:solutionSpace}
In previous chapter we have discuss about how \ac{paas} cloud model is able to meet the issues risen
by software-house and companies that uses deployed software in their daily activities.

A \ac{paas} vendor is not good only if it is able to provide us unlimited hardware resources and well
designed work environments to support our applications or services. A key factor is elasticity, because
as we can see in this chapter is the one that can make our deployed services or application multi-tenant.

So, in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-introduction} we want to introduce the reader about the elasticity
concept, to continue then in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-requirements} illustrating the its main
characteristic. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-multiTenancy} we illustrate the concept of
multi-tenancy explaining why it is correlated to the elasticity one and why software-houses may
decide to deploy software in \ac{paas} that has this characteristics.
