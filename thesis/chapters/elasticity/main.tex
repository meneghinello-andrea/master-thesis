\chapter{Elasticity}
\label{cap:solutionSpace}
In the previous chapter we have discussed about how \ac{paas} cloud model is able to meet the issues risen
by software-houses and companies that use deployed software in their daily activities.

A \ac{paas} vendor offers a good service only if it is able to provide us unlimited hardware resources and
well designed work environments to support our applications or services. A key factor is elasticity, because,
as we can see in this chapter, is the one that can make our deployed services or applications multi-tenant.

Thus, in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-introduction} we want to introduce the reader about the concept of
elasticity, to continue then in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-requirements} illustrating its main
characteristics. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:elasticity-multiTenancy} we will illustrate the concept of
multi-tenancy, explaining why it is correlated to elasticity and why software-houses may
decide to deploy software in \ac{paas} that has these characteristics.
