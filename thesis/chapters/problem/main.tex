\chapter{Problem space}
\label{cap:problemSpace}
With this chapter we want to introduce our thesis talking about main problems that developers
encounter during their work. Our focus will be on cloud computing, with special
attention to \ac{paas} level of \ac{spi} cloud model, as a valid solution to relieve their workload.

We will start describing, in Section \ref{sec:problemSpace-useCases}, some use-cases that illustrate
common scenarios and lead us to consider cloud computing model, in Section 
\ref{sec:problemSpace-cloudComputing} as solution for both companies and software-houses. Later we
will focus our attention on the \ac{paas} cloud model, Section \ref{sec:problemSpace-paas}, 
illustrating its main features and characteristics; we also discuss how this cloud model is possible
through virtualization. Progressively we will illustrate Docker, Section
\ref{sec:problemSpace-docker}, a new \acs{os} virtualization level technology that promise to change
the \ac{paas} cloud model; we illustrate its main characteristics, architecture, how it provide
data-management to conclude with a brief digression about the state-of-the-art of security
issues. Finally Section \ref{sec:problemSpace-problem} will give a formal description of the
problem that we will face for the rest of the thesis.
