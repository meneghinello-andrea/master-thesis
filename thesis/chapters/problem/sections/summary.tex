\section{Summary}
\label{sec:problemSpace-summary}
In this chapter we understood that the cloud computing model is an emerging technology and why the market
is moving its attention on it, by investing money and running applications on it. The trend is positive
and it is expected to grow more and more in the future.

We have also argued about the major requests made by software developers. Their need for automatic
hardware configuration lead to the creation of the \ac{paas} cloud model.

However, \ac{paas} is not free from issues, because even if \ac{paas} model hides the hardware level
developers also want that their deployed applications exploit the elasticity property provided by the
cloud.

Elasticity and Multi-tenancy are becoming interesting concepts in \ac{paas}. The next chapter is focused
on these two concepts, illustrating how they can be applied both with virtualization and containerization.
