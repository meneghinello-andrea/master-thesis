\chapter{Measurements}
\label{cap:measurements}
In order to offer high level of service a \ac{paas} provider must install, on its physical systems,
a virtualization layer that is able to exploit the underlying hardware as better as it can. Is not
sufficient that the layer virtualize the fundamental assets (see Section
\ref{sec:background-virtualization-assets}), it must contain also a good resource scheduler. It should
be able to schedule the different workloads in devices that have hardware resources conform with the
current workload in order to assure elasticity.

In this chapter we want to try to isolate and understand the overhead introduced by \ac{vm}s
(specifically \ac{kvm}) and containers (specifically Docker). The fact that Linux is able to host
both \ac{vm}s and Docker containers creates the opportunity for an apple-to-apple comparison between
these two virtualization technologies.

Thus, in the following sections we report the results collected during the comparison tests. Each 
section illustrate the purpose of the test, illustrate the collected results and try to explain them.
